# CODESOFT-TASK---TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION
This project takes the historic tragedy of the Titanic and turns it into a hands-on Machine Learning challenge. Using the well-known Titanic dataset, it predicts whether a passenger would survive based on features like ticket class, gender, age, family aboard, fare, and embarkation point.
